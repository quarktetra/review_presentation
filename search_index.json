The model is based on magnetic clusters with uniaxial anisotropy, where two-state qubits are formed utilizing the two lowest-lying states of an anisotropic potential energy. We outline the quantum dynamics required by quantum computing for single qubit structures, and then define a measurement scheme in which qubit states can be measured by sharp changes in current as voltage across the cluster is varied. We then extend the single qubit description to multiple qubit interactions, facilitated specifically by an entanglement method that propagates the controlled-NOT (C-NOT) quantum gate..

A classical computer processes one input at a time to calculate the output. On the other hand, in quantum computing (QC), one can make use of quantum superpositions to explore multiple inputs and corresponding outputs simultaneously[1], [2] and make use of interference to speed up calculations. This feature gives QC important advantages for certain tasks such as searching for an item in an unsorted database. Certain quantum sorting algorithms can complete such a query in \\(\\sqrt{N}\\) tries, whereas classical algorithms would require on the order of \\(N\\) tries, where \\(N\\) is the total number of items in the database[3]. Additionally, quantum computers can handle problems like the prime-factorization of large numbers[4] which are practically impossible even for supercomputers. In a quantum computer, the fundamental element is called a \\(qubit\\), which is a physical system with two well-defined states, represented by \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\). The crucial difference between a qubit and a bit is that a qubit can be in a superposition of states, i.e., \\[\\begin{equation} |\\psi\\rangle=\\alpha|0\\rangle+\\beta|1\\rangle, \\, \\text{where}\\, |\\alpha|^2+|\\beta|^2=1 \\label{eq:psi} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(|\\psi\\rangle\\) is the wave function describing the state. Quantum algorithms involve operations on individual qubit states as well as operations that require inter-qubit interactions. A multi-qubit quantum computer must be able to create entangled states by exploiting physical interactions between qubits, which can be realized as Heisenberg type spin-spin coupling, spin-orbital coupling and several other types of interactions. There have been several different proposals for physical implementation of qubits; for instance, some approaches implement superconducting qubits based on Josephson junctions[5][10]. Google recently reported running quantum algorithms on a 53-superconducting-qubit quantum computer[11]. There are also methods using the polarization and propagation direction of photons as the states of the qubits[12]. Nuclear magnetic resonance QC[13][16] (NMR QC) uses the nuclei of certain molecules to form qubits. The need for scalability is the main reason many believe a practical quantum computer should be based on solid state technology for which fabrication techniques are very well developed[17], [18]. In this work, we are proposing a novel, solid-state-based QC model using magnetic clusters (MCs) as qubits. The proposed model satisfies all five DiVincenzo criteria[19], each of which will be discussed below in detail. Magnetic Cluster as qubits Nanometer size magnetic clusters with high anisotropy have been proposed as qubits[20][23]. Potential candidates for magnetic clusters could be molecular magnets such as \\(\\rm{Fe}_8\\) or \\(\\rm{Mn}_{12}\\). They can be described as quantum systems with large spins at low enough temperatures[23][25]. Figure 1: Single qubit structure: The magnetic cluster is suspended between two contacts in an insulating matrix.  [+] The cluster is chosen to have a small spin (\\(S&lt;100\\)), but a high anisotropy energy. Contacts may be ordinary conducting material (Au). \\(B_0\\) is a fixed, strong magnetic field, whereas \\(B_1\\) oscillates, and the magnitudes of the fields are such that \\(B_1 \\ll B_0\\) . The qubit consists of a magnetic cluster placed in between two contact terminals, depicted in Fig. plotref_singleq_NTT . The system is placed in a large magnetic field that is aligned with the anisotropy axis of the MC. A small, oscillating magnetic field is applied in the perpendicular direction to control the qubit state. The state of the qubit can be read out by applying a voltage across the terminals. Since MC QC inhabits a solid state environment for which fabrication techniques are well established, the scalability problem can potentially be overcome[26], [27]. Hamiltonian and energy states The MC, depicted in Fig. plotref_singleq , has a uniaxial magnetic anisotropy along the axis of the applied magnetic field, \\(B_0\\). When the transverse magnetic field, \\(B_1\\), is turned off, the Hamiltonian of the system can be written as: \\[\\begin{equation} H_0=-K\\boldsymbol{S}_z^2-\\gamma \\hbar \\boldsymbol{S}_z B_0, \\tag{1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(K\\) is the anisotropy energy, \\(\\boldsymbol{S}\\) is the spin, \\(\\gamma\\) is the gyromagnetic ratio, and \\(B_0\\) is the magnitude of the field. Figure 2: Anisotropic Magnetic Potential Energy and Quantum States.  [+] The states of the MC in no externally applied magnetic field form a degenerate, double potential well, which has two minima when the spin is aligned with the uniaxial anisotropy axis of the MC. The degeneracy is lifted by the applied magnetic field. The two lowest energy states of the MC serve as the qubit states. Figure 3: The energy levels of the first three states and the energy gaps in between. The excitation energy is the energy required to make the transition from a given state to the next higher level. The eigenstates of the Hamiltonian are labeled by the spin quantum numbers, \\(S_z\\in \\{-S,-S+1,\\cdots,S-1,S\\}\\), and the corresponding energy levels are shown in Fig. plotref_thetable_NTT . After the initialization, the qubit will be in the ground state: \\(|0\\rangle\\), which corresponds to \\(S_z=S\\). The first excited state of the qubit is the one corresponding to \\(S_z=S-1\\), denoted by \\(|1\\rangle\\). The energy required to make the transition from the first excited state to the second is \\(\\Delta E\\equiv E_2-E_1=K(2S-3)-\\gamma \\hbar B_0\\). Transitions to out of the subspace are activated by phonons [28], which we will consider later in Fig. plotref_decoherence . We are going to compute the coherence time later. Approximate Hamiltonian If the temperature is such that \\(k_B T\\ll\\Delta E\\), where \\(k_B\\) is the Boltzmann constant, the number of phonons with enough energy to make such a transition is exponentially suppressed. The discussion can be limited to the subspace spanned by states \\(|0\\rangle\\equiv \\left(1 \\,0\\right)^T\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\equiv \\left(0 \\,1\\right)^T\\). In this subspace, \\(\\boldsymbol{S}_z^2\\) can be represented by a \\(2\\times2\\) matrix, which can be rewritten in terms of \\(\\boldsymbol{S}_z\\) follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\boldsymbol{S}_z^2= \\begin{bmatrix} S^2 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; (S-1)^2 \\end{bmatrix}=(2S-1) \\boldsymbol{S}_z-S(S-1)\\boldsymbol{I}. \\tag{2} \\end{equation}\\] In this representation, we can rewrite the original Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) as: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} H_0&amp;=&amp;-[K(2S-1)+\\gamma \\hbar B_0 ] \\boldsymbol{S}_z+\\beta I\\equiv - \\hbar w_0 \\boldsymbol{S}_z, \\tag{3} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where \\(w_0=\\frac{K}{ \\hbar} (2S-1)-\\gamma B_0\\), and \\(\\beta\\) is a constant which is dropped from the Hamiltonian. With this Hamiltonian for the system, we can now discuss how single-qubit operations may be implemented. Qubit Operations Figure 4: Visualization of the qubit state on the Bloch Sphere. Modified from [29]. Single Qubit Operations We introduce a time dependent magnetic field of magnitude \\(B_1\\) along the \\(x\\)-axis to generate single-qubit operations. With this magnetic field, the effective Hamiltonian becomes: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} H=-\\hbar w _0 \\boldsymbol{S}_z+\\hbar w_1 \\cos(w_{mf} t-\\phi) \\boldsymbol{S}_x, \\tag{4} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where \\(w_1=\\gamma B_1 \\ll w_0, w_{mf}\\) is the frequency of the control magnetic field, and \\(\\phi\\) is the initial phase. Since the Hamiltonian is time dependent, it is convenient to transform the wave function into the rotating frame: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} |\\psi_R(t)\\rangle\\equiv e^{i/\\hbar H_0 t} |\\psi(t)\\rangle=e^{-iw_0 \\boldsymbol{S}_z t}|\\psi(t)\\rangle. \\tag{5} \\end{eqnarray}\\] The Schrodinger Equation in the rotating frame can be written as: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} i \\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}|\\psi_R(t)\\rangle&amp;\\equiv&amp;H_R|\\psi_R(t)\\rangle. \\tag{6} \\end{eqnarray}\\] \\(H_R\\) in Eq. shows that the Hamiltonian in the rotating frame: \\[\\begin{equation} H_R= \\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; e^{-i(\\Delta t+\\phi) }+e^{-i(\\Sigma t-\\phi) }\\\\ e^{i(\\Delta t+\\phi)} +e^{i(\\Sigma t-\\phi)} &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\label{eq:hrsimp} \\end{equation}\\] where we define \\(\\Sigma\\equiv w_0+w_{mf}\\) and \\(\\Delta\\equiv w_0- w_{mf}\\). \\(w_{mf}\\) is the frequency of the control field for which we can choose \\(w_{mf}= w_0\\), which gives \\(\\Sigma=2 w_{mf}\\) and \\(\\Delta=0\\). The terms with \\(\\Sigma\\) are rapidly oscillating, and they average to zero over the time scale for rotations \\(\\frac{1}{w_1}\\). In the rotating wave approximation[30] limit \\(H_R\\) becomes time independent: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} H_R=\\hbar w_1 (cos\\phi \\boldsymbol{S}_x+sin\\phi \\boldsymbol{S}_y ). \\tag{7} \\end{eqnarray}\\] The time development operator at \\(t=\\frac{\\alpha}{w_1}\\) can be written as: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} U_R (t=\\frac{\\alpha}{w_1})&amp;=&amp;e^{-i\\frac{H_R \\alpha}{\\hbar w_1 }}=\\begin{cases} e^{-i\\alpha \\boldsymbol{S}_x }\\equiv X(\\alpha) , \\,\\,\\phi=0, \\\\ e^{-i\\alpha \\boldsymbol{S}_y }\\equiv Y(\\alpha) , \\,\\,\\phi=\\pi. \\\\ \\end{cases} \\tag{8} \\end{eqnarray}\\] \\(U_R\\) can be used to generate rotations around the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes. Although Eq. (8) lacks \\(\\boldsymbol{S}_z\\), the rotations around the \\(z\\)-axis in the subspace spanned by \\(|0\\rangle\\) and \\(|1\\rangle\\) can be generated as a series of rotations around the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes. This follows from the identity: \\[\\begin{equation} Z(\\alpha)\\equiv X\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{2 S}}\\right)Y\\left(\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{2 S}}\\right) X^\\dagger \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2\\sqrt{2 S}}\\right). \\label{eq:zcreation} \\end{equation}\\] Two-qubit operations Figure 5: Two-Qubit Structure. A two-qubit system can be implemented by aligning two single qubits in a stacked structure. In order to create a two-qubit system, two individual qubits are placed in close proximity. The Hamiltonian for this 2-qubit system is given by: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} H&amp;=&amp;-\\sum_{i=1}^2 \\hbar w_0^i \\boldsymbol{S}_z^i +\\sum_{i=1}^2 \\hbar w_1^i \\boldsymbol{S}_x^i \\cos(w_{mf}^i t-\\phi^i )\\nonumber\\\\ &amp;-&amp;J^{c} \\boldsymbol{S}^1\\cdot\\boldsymbol{S}^2, \\tag{9} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where the indices label qubits, and \\(J^{c}\\) is the strength of the coupling. \\(\\boldsymbol{S}^1\\cdot\\boldsymbol{S}^2\\) will enable entanglement between qubits. We transform the wave function into the rotating frame: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} |\\psi_R^{(2)}(t)\\rangle\\equiv e^{-iw_0^1 \\boldsymbol{S}_z^1 t} e^{-iw_0^2 \\boldsymbol{S}_z^2 t} |\\psi^{(2)}(t)\\rangle, \\tag{10} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where \\(w_0^1\\) and \\(w_0^2\\) are the Larmor frequencies of the first and second qubit, and \\(|\\psi^{(2)}(t)\\rangle\\) and \\(|\\psi_R^{(2)}(t)\\rangle\\) are the wave functions of the two-qubit system in the lab frame and rotating frame, respectively. If \\(\\hbar|w_0^1-w_0^2 |/J^{c}\\gg 1\\), the rotating wave approximation gives the transformed interaction Hamiltonian as: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} H_R^{int}=\\sum_{i=1}^2\\hbar w_1^i \\left[\\cos(\\phi^i ) \\boldsymbol{S}_x^i+\\sin(\\phi^i ) \\boldsymbol{S}_y^i \\right]-J^{c}\\boldsymbol{S}_z^1 \\boldsymbol{S}_z^2.\\tag{11} \\end{eqnarray}\\] In order to create entanglement, we turn off the control magnetic field(\\(w_1^i=0\\) ), and utilize the last term in Eq. (11) . Choosing the basis states as \\(\\{|00\\rangle,|01\\rangle,|10\\rangle,|11\\rangle\\}\\), and calculating \\(U(t^*=\\frac{\\pi\\hbar}{J^{c}}) \\equiv U_R^{int}\\) gives: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\begin{bmatrix} e^{-i\\pi S S&#39; }&amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;0\\\\ 0 &amp; e^{-i\\pi (S S&#39;-S) } &amp;0 &amp;0\\\\ 0 &amp;0&amp; e^{-i\\pi (S S&#39;-S&#39;) } &amp;0\\\\ 0 &amp;0 &amp;0&amp; e^{-i\\pi (S S&#39;-S-S&#39;-1) } \\end{bmatrix}. \\tag{12} \\end{eqnarray}\\] The C-NOT, which flips the second qubit only if the state of the first qubit is \\(|1\\rangle\\), can be realized as follows: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} C_{2,1}&amp;\\equiv&amp;Y_2 \\left(\\frac{\\kappa \\pi}{2}\\right) U_R^{int} \\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\pi}{J^{c}}\\right) X_2 \\left(\\frac{\\kappa \\pi}{2}\\right) Z_2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) Z_1 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\right) =e^{-i\\pi/4} \\begin{bmatrix} 1&amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;0\\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp;0 &amp;0\\\\ 0 &amp;0&amp; 0 &amp;1\\\\ 0 &amp;0 &amp;1&amp;0 \\end{bmatrix}, \\tag{13} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where \\(\\kappa\\equiv\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2S}}\\), and the overall phase \\(e^{-i\\pi/4}\\) can be ignored. This is the beloved C-NOT operator! Read-out Figure 6: States are initialized with \\(\\mathcal{V}\\gg \\mathcal{V}_1\\). After an algorithm is complete, \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is lowered. If the qubit state collapses into the \\(|0\\rangle_e\\otimes| S\\rangle_{MC}\\) ( \\(|0\\rangle_e\\otimes|S-1\\rangle_{MC}\\)) state, a peak will appear at \\(\\mathcal{V}_0 (\\mathcal{V}_1)\\). \\(|\\frac{dI}{d\\mathcal{V}}|\\) peaks correspond to qubit measurements. To measure the final qubit state, we make use of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the cluster[31], [32] which can host one or two electrons. A voltage is applied across the qubit to inject electrons into the LUMO to probe the quantum state of the MC. The state of the electron(s) in the LUMO can be represented by \\(|n,\\boldsymbol{s}_z \\rangle_e\\) , where \\(n\\) is the number of electrons in the state, and \\(\\boldsymbol{s}_z\\) is the \\(z\\)-component of the spin of the electron(s). Using this notation, the composite state of the system can be written as \\(|n,\\boldsymbol{s}_z \\rangle_e \\otimes |m_s \\rangle_{MC}\\), where \\(|m_s \\rangle_{MC}\\) describes the spin state of the MC. Depending on the stage of the computations, \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) will be set to initialize or to read the states. The Hamiltonian describing the MC with the addition of electron(s) in the LUMO can be written as: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} H&amp;=&amp;\\mathtip{-K\\boldsymbol{S}_z^2}{\\text{Anisotropy term}}\\mathtip{-\\gamma \\hbar B_0 \\boldsymbol{S}_z}{\\text{Magnetic cluster-external magnetic field interaction}} +(\\mathtip{\\mathcal{V}}{\\text{Electrostatic energy term}}\\mathtip{-\\gamma \\hbar B_0 \\boldsymbol{s}_z}{\\text{Electron spin-external magnetic field interaction term}}) \\mathtip{\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha^\\dagger c_\\alpha}{\\text{Creation annihilation operators}} +\\mathtip{u c_\\uparrow^\\dagger c_\\uparrow c_\\downarrow^\\dagger c_\\downarrow}{\\text{Electron-electron interaction term}}-\\mathtip{\\frac{J}{2} \\sum_{\\alpha\\beta} c_\\alpha^\\dagger c_\\beta \\boldsymbol{\\sigma}\\cdot \\boldsymbol{S}}{\\text{Electron-magnetic cluster interaction term}}, \\tag{14} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where the operators \\(c_\\alpha^\\dagger\\) and \\(c_\\alpha\\) (indexed with \\(\\alpha\\) for spin polarization: \\(\\uparrow\\) or \\(\\downarrow\\)) are the creation and annihilation operators respectively for electrons in the LUMO, \\(\\boldsymbol{s}_z\\) is the electron spin operator, and \\(u\\) is the electron-electron interaction strength. \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is defined as \\(\\epsilon-eV\\), where \\(\\epsilon\\) is the energy of the electron in LUMO, V is the applied voltage, and \\(J\\) is the strength of the interaction between the MC and the injected electron spin. Figure plotref_readout shows the energy levels \\(E_0\\), \\(E_1\\), and \\(E_0^1\\) as a function of \\(\\mathcal{V}\\). Below is how it works. The eigenstates with no electron occupation \\((n=0)\\) are exactly the eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in Eq. (1) . These states are labeled as \\(|0\\rangle_e\\otimes| S\\rangle_{MC}\\), and \\(|0\\rangle_e\\otimes|S-1\\rangle_{MC}\\) and have energies: \\(E_0=-KS^2-\\gamma \\hbar B_0 S\\), and \\(E_1=-K(S-1)^2-\\gamma \\hbar B_0 (S-1)\\) respectively. The closest energy eigenstate, \\(E_0^1\\), is \\(\\mathtip{|1,1/2\\rangle_e\\otimes| S\\rangle_{MC}}{\\text{Single spin up electron}}\\): \\(E_0^1=-KS^2-\\gamma \\hbar B_0 (S+1/2)+\\mathcal{V}-\\frac{J S}{2}\\). \\(E_0^1\\) changes linearly with the applied voltage since it has one electron in LUMO. All the other states have larger energies either because of the spin polarization of the electron(s), and/or because of smaller \\(m_s\\) values. States are initialized with \\(\\mathcal{V}\\gg \\mathcal{V}_1\\). After an algorithm is complete, \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) is lowered. If the qubit state collapses into the \\(|0\\rangle_e\\otimes| S\\rangle_{MC}\\) ( \\(|0\\rangle_e\\otimes|S-1\\rangle_{MC}\\)) state, a peak will appear at \\(\\mathcal{V}_0 (\\mathcal{V}_1)\\). \\(|\\frac{dI}{d\\mathcal{V}}|\\) peaks correspond to qubit measurements. Decoherence Figure 7: Phonon stimulated excitations. Qubits are physical systems coupled to their environment, which can cause the qubits to lose their quantum nature. The decoherence time of a quantum computer is the lifetime of coherent quantum states. In the case of MC QC, the interaction of the MC with the crystal structure and phonons may result in a transition out of the two-state subspace previously defined. In this section, we discuss the dynamics of decoherence, and calculate the lifetime of an MC qubit, focusing on decoherence originating from phonon-assisted transitions out of the qubits two-state subspace [33][36]. To begin, we must consider physically what occurs in a single-state excitation facilitated by absorption or emission of a phonon, which is depicted in Fig. plotref_phonon_NTT . The states of the system, a few of which are shown in Fig. plotref_phonon , have different energy and angular momentum values. Any transition between two states requires angular momentum and energy transfer to or from the qubit. Excitations in the crystal structure will carry in (or out) the required angular momentum and energy difference. These excitations can be described as transverse phonons: \\(\\boldsymbol{u}(r)\\). Phonons cause perturbations on the angles of the crystal axes: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\delta\\boldsymbol{\\phi}(r)=\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla \\times \\boldsymbol{u}(r). \\tag{15} \\end{eqnarray}\\] The spin-phonon interaction by perturbs the magnetic anisotropy Hamiltonian with the angles \\(\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\) as follows: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} H_{s-ph}&amp;\\equiv&amp; e^{-i\\boldsymbol{S}\\cdot \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\phi}} H_A e^{i\\boldsymbol{S}\\cdot \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\phi}}-H_0 \\simeq (1-i\\boldsymbol{S}\\cdot \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\phi}) H_A (1+i\\boldsymbol{S}\\cdot \\delta \\boldsymbol{\\phi})-H_A =i\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\cdot[H_A,\\boldsymbol{S}], \\tag{16} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where high orders in \\(\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\) are ignored because \\(\\delta\\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\ll1\\), and the Hamiltonian, \\(H_A\\), is the anisotropy contribution of the Hamiltonian defined in Eq. (3) . The decoherence rate corresponding to the transitions to outside the subspace can be calculated using Eq. (16) . We define quantum states, \\(|\\Psi_{f,i}\\rangle=|\\psi_{f,i}\\rangle\\otimes|\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{f,i}\\rangle\\), where the indices, \\(f\\) and \\(i\\), refer to the final and initial states. \\(|\\psi_{f,i}\\rangle\\) and \\(|\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{f,i}\\rangle\\) are the eigenstates of the spin and phonon Hamiltonians, respectively. Two adjacent phonon states differ by one phonon quanta: \\(|\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_f\\rangle=|n_{k,\\lambda}\\rangle\\) and \\(|\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_i\\rangle=|n_{k,\\lambda}+1\\rangle\\), where \\(k\\) is the phonon wavevector, and \\(\\lambda\\in\\{t_1,t_2,l\\}\\) show the transverse and longitudinal polarizations of the phonon. A transition from a state to its adjacent state above is given by the amplitude, \\(\\langle\\Psi_f \\vert H_{s-ph} \\vert \\Psi_i\\rangle =\\boldsymbol{\\Xi}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\), where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\Xi}\\equiv-i\\hbar w_{fi}\\langle\\psi_f \\vert S \\vert \\psi_i\\rangle\\) is the spin matrix element, \\(\\hbar w_{fi}\\) is the energy gap between the two states (listed in Table plotref_thetable ). The phonon matrix elements are given by \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}\\equiv\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hbar}{8MN}} \\sum_{k,\\lambda}\\frac{e^{i\\boldsymbol{k}\\cdot\\boldsymbol{r}}}{\\sqrt{w_{k,\\lambda}}} [i\\boldsymbol{k}\\times \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\boldsymbol{k},\\lambda} ]\\sqrt{n_{w_{fi}}}. \\tag{17} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Using Fermis golden rule and the transition amplitude given above, a general transition rate can be defined as: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\Gamma&amp;=&amp;\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k,\\lambda}\\frac{(\\boldsymbol{k}\\times \\boldsymbol{e}_{\\boldsymbol{k},\\lambda} )^2}{8M\\hbar w_{k,\\lambda} } n_{w_{fi} } |\\boldsymbol{\\Xi}|^2 2\\pi\\delta(w_{k,\\lambda}-w_{fi} )=\\frac{V}{12\\pi\\hbar} \\frac{|\\boldsymbol{\\Xi}|^2 w_{fi}^3}{Mv_t^5 } n_{w_{fi} }, \\label{eq:golden} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where $ n_{w_{fi} }=$ is the phonon occupation number, \\(N\\) is the number of cells in the crystal structure, \\(V\\) is the unit cell volume, \\(M\\) is the mass of the cells, and \\(w_{k,\\lambda}=v_\\lambda k\\) is the phonon frequency. \\(v_\\lambda\\), the speed of phonons, can be estimated as \\(w_{fi} l_c\\) , where \\(l_c\\) is the lattice constant. Decoherence time Figure 8: The ratio of the decoherence time to the gate operation time. The plot shows how many single qubit operations can be completed within the decoherence time for various values of \\(S\\) shown in the legend. Computing \\(|\\boldsymbol{\\Xi}|^2\\propto\\hbar^2 S^2 w_{fi}^2\\) gives the coherence time as: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} \\tau\\simeq \\frac{12 \\pi M l_c^2}{S^2}(e^{\\frac{\\hbar w_{fi}}{k_B T}}-1) ,\\label{eq:dtime} \\end{eqnarray}\\] Note that overall expression depends on the exponential term, which originated from the density of phonons. Since \\(\\hbar w_{fi} \\simeq 2KS\\), the decoherence time increases exponentially with \\(S\\). \\(\\tau\\), must be long enough such that a large number of single-qubit and multi-qubit operations can be executed. By appropriately choosing the values of \\(K\\) and \\(S\\) (i.e., the type of the magnetic cluster), the decoherence time can be made long enough for performing a useful number of operations. To illustrate, let us consider a control magnetic field (\\(B_1\\)) of magnitude \\(0.01\\)T, lattice constant $l_c=1 $ nm, \\(K=0.01\\) meV and compute the ratio of decoherence time \\(\\tau\\) to the gate operation time \\(t_g\\) for various values of \\(S\\), as seen in Fig. plotref_decoherence_NTT . Multi-qubit systems The Hamiltonian for a multi-qubit system can be written as: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} H&amp;=&amp;-\\sum_i \\hbar w_0^i \\boldsymbol{S}_z^i +\\sum_i \\hbar w_1^i \\boldsymbol{S}_x^i \\cos(w_{mf}^i t-\\phi^i )-\\sum_{i&lt;j}J^c_{ij} \\boldsymbol{S}^i\\cdot\\boldsymbol{S}^j, \\tag{18} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where \\(J^c_{ij}\\) is the coupling strength between the \\(i^{\\rm th}\\) and \\(j^{\\rm th}\\) qubit. The coupling strength, \\(J^c_{ij}\\), may decay quickly with distance separating qubits which makes it difficult to directly entangle two nonadjacent qubits. However, one can still entangle any two qubits by a series of operations on subsequent neighboring qubits. For instance, let us consider a three-qubit system for which there is no direct interaction between qubit 1 and qubit 3 (i.e., \\(J^c_{13}\\simeq 0\\)). In this case, one can create a C-NOT operation between the first and third qubit as follows: \\[\\begin{eqnarray} C_{3,1}=C_{3,2} C_{2,1} C_{3,2} C_{2,1}, \\tag{19} \\end{eqnarray}\\] where the C-NOT operations on the right hand side of the equation are implemented by the couplings between neighboring qubits. This idea can easily be generalized to any multi-qubit system.
